List of things need to be done.

* eventstudies package
  - should work with data.frames, zoo, xts
  - create a generic "eventstudies" class
  - DESIGN!!!
    
* phys2eventtime
  - more testing: all output is unitmissing
  - parallelise (provide an argument to the user)
  - document:
  > stopifnot(sum(outcomes=="success") == NCOL(z.e))
    - if data is missing within the width around the event date, we
      simply discard that particular observation from the dataset! 
      
* AMM()
  - vectorise it
  - parallelise it
  - don't ask the user for amm.type in the eventstudies() function
  - separate vignette
  - Rewriting? # XXX
    
* Vignette
  - improvements in AMM()
  - missing entries in .bib
  - need to define all the variables used
  - citation for Corrado (2011) seems misplaced in the beginning. It
    seems as though we are replicating his work on stock-splits, which
    isn't the case

* man pages
  - modify ess.Rd: put reference to Patnaik, Shah, and Singh (2013)

* es-match
  - synthetic returns
